This is the group project due week 14 for DEVOPS-COMP367. 

This project consists of a Client that runs on react, no lint, no testing of any kind. 

The purpose is to show interactions between github and either Jenkins or Azure and to use Azure Boards in order to organize the workflow (in an agile manner).

Screenshots are included with the file submitted through e.centennial.
